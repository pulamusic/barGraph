# GDP Bar Graph

This is a freeCodeCamp data visualization project, making use of the [D3.js JavaScript library](https://d3js.org/).

### NOTES:
* use `http-server` as a development server since D3.js will not work by just opening the index.html file in a browser.
* When doing the D3 tutorial on freeCodeCamp I took notes on [Repl.it](https://repl.it/repls) with at least 9 different example projects. Lean on these when creating the current project.
